# EE314-Term-Project

<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, We are KlausShip</h1>

## Who Are We?
KlausShip is a EE314 group (2024 spring semester) that came together for the term project.

## Project Definition
This project involves implementing a classic Space Invaders-inspired game using FPGA boards. The game features an engaging gameplay environment where players control a central spaceship to defend against incoming enemies. The primary screen is constructed using the VGA interface with a resolution of 640 x 480.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- **Spaceship Control**: Players control a central spaceship that can rotate and fire projectiles.
- **Enemy Waves**: Enemies appear from the boundaries of the field and approach the spaceship deliberately.
- **Objective**: Destroy incoming enemies before they breach your defenses. If enemies get past your fortifications, the game is over.

## Key Features
- **VGA Interface**: The primary game screen is displayed using the VGA interface at a resolution of 640 x 480.
- **Rotating Spaceship**: The spaceship can rotate, allowing players to strategically aim and fire at enemies.
- **Projectile Firing**: Players can fire projectiles to destroy approaching enemies.
- **Strategic Maneuvering**: Players must maneuver strategically to defend against enemy waves.
